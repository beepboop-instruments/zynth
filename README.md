# 🎹 Zynth - FPGA-based Polyphonic Synthesizer

Zynth is a **System-on-Chip (SoC)**-based **128-note polyphonic synthesizer** built on FPGA technology. It supports real-time generation and mixing of multiple classic waveforms including:

- ✅ Sine
- ✅ Pulse-width modulation (PWM)
- ✅ Sawtooth
- ✅ Ramp
- ✅ Triangle

> Designed to offer massive polyphony, rich waveform shaping, and low-latency performance — all powered by custom logic and embedded software.
